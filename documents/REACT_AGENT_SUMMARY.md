### 4. **Enhanced Problem-Solving Process**

The agent follows a systematic approach:

1. **Understand**: Analyze user requirements and constraints
2. **Plan**: Determine what information is needed and which tools to use
3. **Execute**: Use tools to gather data and perform calculations
4. **Analyze**: Process results and identify patterns/insights
5. **Recommend**: Provide personalized recommendations with clear reasoning
6. **Explain**: Help users understand environmental and practical implications

## üß™ Example Queries the Agent Can Handle

### Complex Multi-Criteria Queries
```
"I need to travel from Delhi to Mumbai next week. I'm environmentally conscious but also need to arrive quickly. What are my best options?"
```

**Agent Process:**
1. **Thought**: Analyze requirements (source, destination, time constraint, priorities)
2. **Action**: Get comprehensive travel options
3. **Observation**: Retrieve travel data with CO2 emissions and durations
4. **Thought**: Analyze trade-offs between speed and environmental impact
5. **Action**: Perform detailed environmental impact analysis
6. **Final Answer**: Provide reasoned recommendations with clear trade-offs

### Environmental Impact Analysis
```
"How much CO2 will I emit if I fly from Bangalore to Delhi, and how can I offset it?"
```

**Agent Process:**
1. **Thought**: User wants specific CO2 calculation and offsetting strategies
2. **Action**: Calculate emissions for flight
3. **Observation**: Get CO2 emissions data
4. **Action**: Get offsetting strategies
5. **Final Answer**: Provide specific numbers and actionable offsetting strategies

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. **Configure Environment**
```bash
# Edit backend/agent/.env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
AGENT_MODEL=gpt-4o
AGENT_TEMPERATURE=0.1
AGENT_MAX_TOKENS=2000
```

### 2. **Start the Application**
```bash
# Option 1: Use the startup script
./start_with_agent.sh

# Option 2: Start manually
cd agent && source venv/bin/activate && python start_agent.py
