# Advanced ReAct Travel Planning Agent

This implementation uses LangChain's ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent pattern with GPT-4o for advanced travel planning with sophisticated reasoning capabilities.

## What is ReAct?

ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) is a framework that combines reasoning and acting in language models. It allows the agent to:

1. **Think** about what to do next
2. **Act** by using tools to gather information
3. **Observe** the results
4. **Repeat** until the problem is solved

This creates a more transparent and reliable decision-making process compared to traditional approaches.

## Usage Examples

### Complex Travel Planning
```
User: "I need to travel from Delhi to Mumbai next week. I'm environmentally conscious but also need to arrive quickly. What are my best options?"

Agent Process:
1. Thought: I need to understand the user's requirements - source (Delhi), destination (Mumbai), time constraint (next week), priorities (environmental + speed)
2. Action: Use advanced_travel_planner to get comprehensive options
3. Observation: Get travel data with CO2 emissions and durations
4. Thought: Now I need to analyze the trade-offs between speed and environmental impact
5. Action: Use environmental_analyzer to get detailed impact analysis
6. Observation: Get detailed environmental analysis and offsetting strategies
7. Final Answer: Provide reasoned recommendations with clear trade-offs
```

### Environmental Impact Analysis
```
User: "How much CO2 will I emit if I fly from Bangalore to Delhi, and how can I offset it?"

Agent Process:
1. Thought: User wants specific CO2 calculation for flight and offsetting strategies
2. Action: Use co2_calculator to calculate emissions for flight
3. Observation: Get CO2 emissions data
4. Action: Use environmental_analyzer to get offsetting strategies
5. Observation: Get detailed offsetting options
6. Final Answer: Provide specific numbers and actionable offsetting strategies
```

## API Response Format

The ReAct agent returns enhanced responses:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "Detailed reasoning and recommendations...",
  "travel_data": null,
  "error": null,
  "intermediate_steps": [
    {
      "action": "advanced_travel_planner",
      "action_input": "{\"source\": \"Delhi\", \"destination\": \"Mumbai\"}",
      "observation": "Travel data retrieved..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Multi-Criteria Analysis
The agent can analyze travel options across multiple dimensions:
- **Environmental Impact**: CO2 emissions, tree offset requirements
- **Time Efficiency**: Travel duration, convenience factors
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Price considerations (when data available)
- **Comfort Level**: Mode-specific comfort factors

### 2. Personalized Recommendations
Based on user preferences:
- **Eco Priority**: Emphasizes low-emission options
- **Time Constraint**: Prioritizes faster options
- **Budget Consideration**: Balances cost and other factors
- **Comfort Preference**: Considers comfort levels

### 3. Environmental Impact Categorization
- **Very Low**: < 1 kg CO2
- **Low**: 1-5 kg CO2
- **Medium**: 5-20 kg CO2
- **High**: 20-50 kg CO2
- **Very High**: > 50 kg CO2

### 4. Carbon Offsetting Strategies
- **Tree Planting**: Specific number of trees needed
- **Renewable Energy Credits**: Cost estimates
- **Alternative Transportation**: Eco-friendly alternatives

## Performance Benefits

### Reasoning Transparency
- Users can see the agent's thinking process
- Easier to debug and improve
- More trustworthy recommendations

### Better Problem Solving
- Handles complex, multi-faceted queries
- Can break down problems into steps
- Recovers from errors gracefully

```

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
   ```

3. **Start the Agent**:
   ```bash
   python start_agent.py
   ```

4. **Test the Agent**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "What is the most eco-friendly way to travel from Delhi to Mumbai?"}'
   ```

## Example Queries

The ReAct agent excels at complex queries:

- "I need to travel from Delhi to Mumbai next week. I'm environmentally conscious but also need to arrive quickly. What are my best options?"
- "Compare the environmental impact of flying vs taking a train from Bangalore to Chennai, and suggest how I can offset the emissions."
- "I'm planning a multi-city trip: Delhi ‚Üí Mumbai ‚Üí Bangalore. What's the most sustainable route, and how much CO2 will I emit?"
- "What are the best eco-friendly travel options for a family of 4 traveling from Hyderabad to Kolkata?"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent gets stuck in loops**: Increase `max_iterations` or improve tool descriptions
2. **Poor reasoning quality**: Adjust temperature or improve prompt template
3. **Tool errors**: Check tool implementations and input validation
4. **Memory issues**: Monitor conversation buffer size

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging to see the agent's reasoning:
```python
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=tools,
    verbose=True,  # Shows reasoning steps
    handle_parsing_errors=True
)
```

## Future Enhancements
